### Hello! I'm Terry (he/him) 👋

I am a digital media artist making games, graphics, videos, websites, and everything under the virtual sun. I am an alumni of the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Game Design. I like being a part of projects that are exciting, unique, and stylish! I also love participating in game jams, hackathons, and creative challenges. Thanks for stopping by my Github profile!
