### Hello! I'm Terry (He/him) ðŸ‘‹

I am a digital media artist making games, graphics, videos, and everything under the sun. I am an alumni of the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Game Design. I like being a part of creative projects that are exciting, unique, and stylish! I also love participating in game jams, hackathons, and creative challenges.
